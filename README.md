## Overview

Gold Market MLOps is an end-to-end machine learning system designed to forecast gold prices and classify market risk levels within a production-ready MLOps pipeline.

The system integrates data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and automated retraining into a unified workflow.

Key capabilities:

- 7-day ahead gold price forecasting  
- Volatility-based risk classification  
- Drift detection (covariate and concept drift)  
- Sliding-window continual learning  
- Model versioning with MLflow  
- REST API deployment with FastAPI  
- Containerized execution with Docker  
- CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions  

## Machine Learning Tasks

### 1. Time-Series Regression

- Objective: Forecast gold prices 7 days ahead    
- Validation: Time-based split & rolling window backtesting  
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Mean Directional Accuracy  

### 2. Risk Classification

- Objective: Classify market condition into Low, Medium, High Risk  
- Labeling based on volatility distribution  
- Metric: F1-score (focus on High Risk class)  

## System Architecture

The system consists of four primary layers:

### Data Engineering Layer

- Daily ingestion from financial API (XAU/USD)
- Schema validation and anomaly checking
- Feature engineering (lag features, rolling mean, rolling standard deviation, returns)
- Time-aware processing to prevent data leakage

### Machine Learning Layer

- Rolling window training
- Time-based validation
- Backtesting evaluation
- MLflow model tracking and registry

### Deployment Layer

- Docker containerization
- CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions

### Monitoring & Continual Learning Layer

- Performance monitoring (MAPE threshold tracking)
- Distribution shift detection
- Drift-triggered retraining
- Scheduled retraining strategy
- Structured inference logging

## Running the Project with GitHub Codespaces

This project can be executed directly in a cloud development environment using **GitHub Codespaces**, allowing users to run the full MLOps pipeline without installing dependencies locally.
1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Code → Codespaces → Create Codespace on main**.
3. Wait until the development environment finishes initializing.

GitHub Codespaces will automatically provide a cloud-based development environment with the necessary tools.
